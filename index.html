<h2>Pragmatic Programer Chapter 1 Insights</h2>
<h3>Post 2: 1/16/2017</h3>

<p> 
	The main insights that I found important in chapter 1 are to look at the bigger picture,
take responsibility for your work, be a source of change, make sure your code is good enough, and invest
in your knowledge portfolio. Starting this off, I really like how the book goes into keeping in mind the bigger
picture of a project. You need to make sure that what you are delivering is what the organization, or team,
really needs and not to go program off on a tangent and turn the project into something it is not. Going off
of that each person needs to take responsibility of their part of the project. This doesn't mean for a person 
to go and be a hermit and work on their project by themselves, this means they need to go and work on it but
keep in mind it is a team effort and ask questions when they arrise. Also if something goes wrong, own it
try to fix it as best as you can and then go and talk with the manager/team/teacher.

	The next point that was brought up was to make sure your code is "good enough". I put that in quotation
to say that it doesn't mean that your code is to be sloppy and bad but that it meets your teams goals. This 
rounds back to the idea that you should focus on the bigger picture of the project and make sure it meets team
requirements. Lastly, the main point I took away from this is that you need to stay up to date on the field.
Continuing to invest in your education will help you succeed as a Software engineer, programmer, or whatever
field you decide to focus on. Overall this chapter was very incitful and I enjoyed reading it.

<h2>What software engineering means to me.</h2>

	Software engineering is what makes everything work in today's world. It allows me cook food in a microwave,
play video games on my Playstation, and turn in homework. It lets everyone in this world stay connected because
with out software we wouldn't have applications like Skype to stay connected. Its one of those things that
everyone sees and uses in a day to day setting but you wouldn't really realize it unless you thought about it.
Overall its one of the most important disciplines that will continue to be important and become even more 
important as time goes on.

<h2>What software engineering means to me.</h2>

<p>Software engineering is what makes everything work in today's world. It allows me cook food in a microwave,
play video games on my Playstation, and turn in homework. It lets everyone in this world stay connected because
with out software we wouldn't have applications like Skype to stay connected. Its one of those things that
everyone sees and uses in a day to day setting but you wouldn't really realize it unless you thought about it.
Overall its one of the most important disciplines that will continue to be important and become even more 
important as time goes on.
